        <p>Hello! my name is Andres Vera. I am crazy to learn new things, specially if I have the chance to travel
            around the world to learn and have new experiences. My new great aventure is going on right now, I am
            becoming a fullsatck web developer and I am avid to learn more and more every day. I am determinate to
            become one of the best on my class so in the months ahead I can be a great asset to any company that would
            like me to colaborate with.</p>

        <p> I was born in Peru, I live in Central Forida for a couple of years now and I love it. A couple of years ago
            I've learned to install solar panels and I had the chance to travel to a small village in the jungle of
            Nicaragua to install a whole system at a local school. I was a UCF student at the college of Aerospace
            Engineering, but I had to go back to Peru to take care of some business and I wasn't able to finish it when
            I came back, but I am sure that someday I will be back on track and finish what I started. I have a rescue
            dog called Ludo, he is a sharpei and a very sweet dog.
